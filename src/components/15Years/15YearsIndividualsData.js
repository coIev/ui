		Meet Nilda! As a married mother of six children, she works hard to support her family. Nilda lives in the Philippines, where she owns a nipa – a stilt house indigenous to the Philippines – roofing business and earns additional income from raising pigs.
		</p><p>
		Nilda borrowed her 12th loan through long-time Kiva Field Partner NWTF to buy nipa leaves, bamboo sticks, and other materials to continue to grow her business. She hopes that her hard work, along with a helping hand from NWTF and Kiva, will help her achieve her dream to save enough money to pay for her children’s college tuition.

		Lihn Do's journey to becoming a Kiva lender began at a young age. "My parents came to Australia as refugees. Even though we didn't have a lot ourselves growing up, they always instilled in my brother and me that we could be doing something to help other people,” she said. Her family's background and values combined with her interest in the "idea that a dollar can go further than just what a dollar represents” sparked her interest in Kiva's model of crowdfunded microlending.
		</p><p>
		"I really love being a lender on Kiva because it makes me embrace and practice the values that I have.”
		</p><p>
		Lihn is based in Melbourne, Australia. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic, she traveled often for work. Her travels heightened her awareness to "the fact that when you're a tourist or in a specific location for work, you don't get to see everything that country has to offer. That includes the problems that exist there. So I tend to try to support [loans] in locations that I'm also working in or a place that I've read about, just to learn a bit more about the world.”
		</p><p>
		Lihn prefers to lend to female entrepreneurs and small business owners. She recognizes that women typically have more difficulty accessing, or entirely lack access to, traditional funding sources, like banks. She wants to help Kiva bridge this gap, even if in a small way.
		</p><p>
		Lihn's favorite aspect of lending on Kiva.org? The short-term, tangible impact that lending as little as $25 can have on people's lives. "There's such a thrill about being able to browse a website, and rather than doing online shopping or something for yourself, knowing that every time you click to add a loan to your basket, you're actually helping someone else in the world. It feels like such a privilege to be able to do that.”
		</p><p>
		She also enjoys sharing this passion for lending through Kiva with her community and often recruits new lenders. "One of the most impactful things that I've really enjoyed being able to do is telling other people about microfinance and expanding the number of people in my own community that have since joined Kiva.”
		</p><p>
		It's been particularly interesting for Lihn to have these conversations about Kiva and to see people realize that they, too, can have life-changing impact on people's lives without it requiring a large sum of money. "All of us can participate.”
		</p><p>
		In the future, Lihn is eager to see just how impactful Kiva can be, "Kiva turning 15 is pretty amazing. It proves all of the naysayers wrong that microfinance isn't something that works, isn't something that makes an impact, or isn't something that people would be interested in. I'm really excited to see how Kiva can continue to extend its impact.”

		<p>
		Howard Zugman was reading the newspaper on New Year’s Day in 2008 when he came upon an article sharing better ways to make a New Year’s resolution. For those tired of joining a gym only to stop going a couple of months later, the article instead suggested, among other options, lending money to the world’s most financially excluded individuals on Kiva.org. But Howard was skeptical.
		</p><p>
		Initially, Howard felt that the Kiva model was too good to be true. Why would someone lend money to a stranger, possibly one who lives thousands of miles away, without the guarantee of repayment? On the other hand, he felt that if the model did work, then what an unmatched opportunity to create impact.
		</p><p>
		To resolve his internal conflict and assess the credibility of lending through Kiva, Howard created a spreadsheet recording all loans fundraising on Kiva. By the time he was finished, he counted 4,000 loans of varying amounts from around the globe. This led him to conclude that Kiva was trustworthy, that “no one could be dumb enough to put all of this effort into a scam.” He decided to start lending.
		</p><p>
		Howard set his sights on two goals: he would be Kiva’s most prolific lender; and he would lend $1M by January 1, 2020. He quickly realized these were expensive aspirations. Where would he get the money?
		</p><p>
		Howard has been singing, for a small fee, at retirement homes for 32 years. He had been unsure of what to do with these modest earnings until he realized he could use them to help other people by lending on Kiva. With his Kiva superlender aspirations feeling more within reach, Howard began his lending journey.
		</p><p>
		"Kiva has become a very important part of my life. Every morning with my coffee I make my loans. If nothing else goes right that day, I know something good has happened."
		</p><p>
		As a Bay Area native, and with Kiva headquarters located in San Francisco, Howard considers himself fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet many Kivans over the years. After initially focusing his lending internationally, he realized that lending to U.S. borrowers located in the Bay Area meant that he could meet them, too. To date, Howard has met at least 70 of the U.S. borrowers he has supported. This sense of community among Kiva lenders, borrowers, and staff serves as a source of great joy and inspiration to Howard, “It’s been wonderful to be a part of Kiva. I’ve gotten out of it much more than I’ve put in.”
		</p><p>
		Although Howard fell just short of his initial lending aspirations, he has created life-changing impact for thousands of Kiva borrowers over the past 12 years. Kiva’s community of generous lenders, like Howard, is fundamental to building the financially inclusive world we envision.
		</p><p>
		"[Kiva] allows me to create the world that I want it to be, in a small way. That’s all because I happened to pick up the paper that day with my coffee." We’re so happy you did, Howard.

		Growing up in Peru and now living in the United Kingdom, Eduardo has come full circle. He now explores his home country, and many others, through the Spanish loans that he translates as a volunteer with Kiva.
		</p><p>
		In the Kiva sphere, Eduardo works as a Volunteer Translator. He sees loans in their original language, in his case Spanish, and translates the text into English. Because Kiva borrowers are from all parts of the world, not all loan profiles come to us in English. More than 400 volunteers around the world, like Eduardo, translate and edit Kiva loans before they reach the site.
		</p><p>
		He’s been translating for Kiva for 3 years and this continuity with Kiva has allowed him to see some borrowers coming back to Kiva to request their second and third loans. For Eduardo, it’s rewarding to see these borrowers thriving in their endeavors and growing more successful.
		</p><p>
		“I want to see people succeed and I know that Kiva provides opportunities for people to do that.”
		</p><p>
		Kiva helps people move ahead in life, whether it’s to kick start their business ideas, finish their studies, or improve their living conditions. For Eduardo, this was a major draw for him to Kiva.
		</p><p>
		It struck him that many around the world are already so skilled; they just need an extra push from a Kiva loan and the collaboration of many lenders around the world to capitalize on their existing skills.
		</p><p>
		For Eduardo, and for many of us during this pandemic, aspects of life have changed drastically. However, his work for Kiva and what Kiva means to him is still the same.
		</p><p>
		Borrowers, now more than ever during an economy affected by COVID-19, depend on Kiva. Eduardo knows that Kiva continue to provide financial access and connect borrowers to a wide audience of lenders.
